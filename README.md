# VBA_Challenge
## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to provide the client with the analyis of two years' of data for any number of stocks at the touch of a button.  We were also tasked with evaluating using arrays as an alternative method to establish our variables and determine how efficient the code would be.
## Stock Results and Code Efficiency
The results of the 2-year portfolio analysis were as follows:

Regarding stock performance, the client will find that 2018 was clearly a more bullish year than 2017.
